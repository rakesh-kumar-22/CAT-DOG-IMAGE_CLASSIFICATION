## Project Overview

In this project, we build and train a neural network to classify images of cats and dogs. The classifier aims to accurately predict whether an image contains a cat or a dog based on patterns learned from training data.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes thousands of images of cats and dogs. For training and validation, a 80:20 split is used. You can download a popular dataset for this task from [Kaggle's Dogs vs. Cats Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data).

- **Training Images:** ~80%
- **Validation Images:** ~20%

## Model Architecture

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used for this classification task, leveraging layers such as:

1. Convolutional Layers
2. Pooling Layers
3. Fully Connected Layers
4. Dropout Layers (for regularization)

Popular pre-trained models like **VGG16, ResNet50, or MobileNet** can also be used to improve accuracy through transfer learning.

## Training

The model was trained using the following parameters:

- **Loss Function:** Categorical Crossentropy
- **Optimizer:** Adam
- **Batch Size:** 32
- **Epochs:** 10-20 (adjustable for fine-tuning)

Training was conducted with data augm
